# Spline
Spline C# Implementation

## Environment & Dependency

- .NETCore 3.1


## Features

- Bezier Curve
- B-Spline
- Nurbs Curve

## To be developed

- Nurbs Surface

## Explanation

- **Bezier Curve**: Approximation spline (Don't pass through point)   
- **B-Spline**: Generalization of Bezier Curve using knot vector
- **NURBS Curve**: Generalization of B-Spline using weights. Each control points have corresponding weight. NURBS is acronym of Non-Uniform Raional B-Spline. In this context, the "Rational" means using wieghts.
