# SplineSharp
Spline C# Implementation

## Environment & Dependency

- .NETCore 3.1


## Features

- Bezier Curve 
- Bezier Surface 
- B-Spline
- B-Spline Surface 
- Nurbs Curve
- Nurbs Surface 


## To be developed

- T-Spline

## Explanation

- **Bezier Curve**: Approximation spline (Don't pass through point)   
- **B-Spline**: Generalization of Bezier Curve using knot vector
- **NURBS Curve**: Generalization of B-Spline using weights. Each control points have corresponding weight. NURBS is acronym of Non-Uniform Raional B-Spline. In this context, the "Rational" means using wieghts. 
- **Bezier Surface**: tensor product of two Bezier curves
- **B-Spline Surface**: tensor product of two B-Spline curves
- **NURBS Surface**: tensor product of two NURBS curves
